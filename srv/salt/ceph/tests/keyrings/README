The general idea is that keyrings work.  Over time, keyrings will be restricted to only the permissions necessary.  All sls files are checking that a ceph query using the respective keyring returns successfully.  Some sls files check that a ceph query fails.

These should never fail, but accidental modification would find an issue immediately.

Extend these sls files if specific ceph commands must always work for a specific keyring and could be disabled by an incorrect capabilities setting.  Tests of Ceph are unnecessary here.

The init.sls includes all other files.  The individual files allow checking specific keyrings.
