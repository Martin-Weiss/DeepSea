.SH Preface
.PP
DeepSea tries to detect disks that can be converted to OSDs. In order to use those disks they have 
to look like spare disks (no partitions). We don't use disks that have partitions on them to avoid overwriting data.
.B Validation:
.RS
DeepSea performs a set of system validation tests before running the ramainder of the stage.

* salt-api
  Is the salt-api running

* DeepSea minion
  See deepsea-minions (7)

* master minion
  Check for the presence of a master minion

* ceph version
  Validate if a ceph version could be found for installation

.SH Example

This command can also be used with the

to give feedback during the process from the Salt event bus. Salt orchestrations are unnervingly silent during 
execution and only report when complete.
